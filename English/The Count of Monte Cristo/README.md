Text and illustrations are in the public domain in the United States. Fonts used, to the best of my knowledge, are free to use for any purpose including commercial. Whatever original work of mine this effort represents, I place into the public domain. In other words, to the best of my knowledge you may make and sell copies of these. I am not a lawyer and you are responsible for compliance with your government's copyright laws.

Footnotes are verbatim from Project Gutenberg's English translation, with the exception of the footnote in chapter 18 giving an approximate equivalent value for the stated value of the treasure (for the record, the original footnote is  "$2,600,000 in 1894."). Since more time has elapsed between 1894 and today than elapsed between 1815 and 1894, the figure given is useless--but updating it was not as simple as I'd hoped, and the text doesn't say (or at least Project Gutenberg doesn't record) how the 1894 editors arrived at their figure. Inflation data doesn't exist further back than the turn of the 20th century or so. Instead of getting bogged down in enormously complex (albeit fascinating) discussions of all the various economic variables that are involved in comparisons of what money was worth in 1815 and in 2025, I went for an extremely straightforward measure: the price of gold in 1815 and 2025.

I have assumed throughout that you are using borderless printing. If your printer adds a border, you will need to make adjustments--the easiest way I've found is to increase BCOR by $borderwidth*2. For my own use (my own printer does not support borderless printing) I also set DIV to an artificially high 15, for smaller margins (since these will be enlarged in printing).

If you are using US letter paper (8.5" x 11"), download the "letter" folder containing the signatures and print them out, double-sided, flip on short side.

If you are using A4, download the "a4" folder containing the signatures and print them out, double-sided, flip on short side.

Source files (top-level and per-chapter files) are in the source directory for each book. You do not need them unless you are preparing your own version. I am using LuaLaTeX.
