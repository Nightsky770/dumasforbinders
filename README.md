# dumasforbinders
The works of Alexander Dumas for the DIY bookbinder. Available in French and English, formatted for letter and a4 paper.

I have removed ''Count of Monte Cristo'' until I can fix the quotations issues. CMC has very complex quotations--people recount conversations in which conversations are quoted; people recount conversations where somebody reads a letter aloud, and both the first-hand and second-hand audiences have emotional reactions to the letter--and csquotes, which expects all environments and quotes to be strictly nested, is having a hard time coping. I should not have hit "commit" until I had proofed more thoroughly. Apologies.

Source files (top-level and per-chapter files) are in the source directory for each book. You do not need them unless you are preparing your own version. I am using LuaLaTeX.
