# dumasforbinders
The works of Alexander Dumas for the DIY bookbinder. Available in French and English, formatted for letter and a4 paper.

Count of Monte Cristo is now back. If you find quotation issues (or, indeed, any issues), please report them.

Source files (top-level and per-chapter files) are in the source directory for each book. You do not need them unless you are preparing your own version. I am using LuaLaTeX.
