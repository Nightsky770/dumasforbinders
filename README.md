# dumasforbinders
The works of Alexander Dumas for the DIY bookbinder. Available in French and English, formatted for letter and a4 paper.


Source files (top-level and per-chapter files) are in the source directory for each book. You do not need them unless you are preparing your own version. I am using LuaLaTeX.
